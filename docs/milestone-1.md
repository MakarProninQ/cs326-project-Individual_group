## Application Idea
People who want to make friends or form a group for some activity such as computer game, hiking, playing chess, reading, or some project often use social networks such as Reddit, Discord, or Facebook, which are not very suitable for this. On these websites, such requests often go unnoticed. So, I decided to make an application that serves that purpose.

My application will allow users to form groups for activities and hobbies. One user will create a group and description for it, and then others can join it. Users will also be able to comment and ask questions about the activity.

This application will help people to make friends and facilitate cooperation.

I got inspiration from Xbox live, where people can post a request to form a group to play. I thought it could apply to other activities too.
