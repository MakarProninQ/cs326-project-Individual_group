## Application Idea
People who want to make friends or form a group for some activity such as computer game, hiking, playing chess, reading, or some project often use social networks such as Reddit, Discord, or Facebook that are not very suitable for this. On these websites, such requests often go unnoticed. So, I decided to make an application that serves that purpose.

My application will allow users to form groups for activities and hobbies. One user will create a group and description for it, and then others can join it. Users will also be able to comment and ask questions about the activity.

This application will help people to make friends and facilitate cooperation.

I got inspiration from Xbox live, where people can post a request to form a group to play. I thought it could apply to other activities too.

## Functionality
First, the application will ask for a username and password. Then, the user will see the list of posted activities. Each will have a type (Ex: computer games) and one small related image. Once the user clicks on one of them, a longer description and comment section will appear. Users will be able to see the number of people that are going to join and the number of participants needed. There will be a button to join and another button to post a new group activity. Users will also be able to see the due date to join the activity. More functionality may be added.
